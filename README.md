Tools for controlling a CNC machine

A python library & associated code for controlling a grbl CNC machine. I'm not at this stage expecting any of this to be of interest to anyone else, but who knows. Essentially, I want more direct control and legal freedom than available tools provide, so I am creating this python framework to produce gcode.
