Work locally in ./cnc.

To add a new file:
  create the file
  git add [FILENAME]
  git commit -a -m "[MESSAGE DESCRIBING THE NEW FILE]"
  git push

After making a change to the code:
  git diff  #  if you forget what you did!
  Commit and upload the change, via these commands:
  git commit -a -m "[MESSAGE DESCRIBING THE CHANGE]"
  git push

Can also try:
  git status

As of 15 November, I'm now editing this repo from two computers. Not much is different, only:
  be especially careful to push changes after each session
  at the start of each session, if the previous work was on the other computer, do:
    git pull

To undo last commit:
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
