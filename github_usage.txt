Work locally in ./cnc.

To add a new file:
  create the file
  git add [FILENAME]

After making a change to the code:
  Commit and upload the change, via these commands:
  git commit -a -m "[MESSAGE DESCRIBING THE CHANGE]"
  git push

Can also try:
  git status

As of 15 November, I'm now editing this repo from two computers. Not much is different, only:
  be especially careful to push changes after each session
  at the start of each session, if the previous work was on the other computer, do:
    git pull
